# week1.day3.pokemonBattle

## Instructions
1. Use command line to create a new project folder called `pokemonBattle`
    - Navigate into the folder and create your required files (`index.html`, `sketch.js`) 
    - Include a reference to p5.js in your `index.html` file
    - Feel free to include additional files according to your needs
2. Follow the plan you’ve made with your group!
3. Keep in mind this will be another MVP - it does NOT need to look perfect.
    - *Note: importing images in p5.js is problematic because of how HTTPS requests are handled and should be avoided - you can simply use simple drawings to represent your Pokemon*
4. This project is open ended! Use everything you’ve learned and try and get as much done as possible within the allotted time frame. 
    - At a minimum you should have 2 Pokemon that battle and subtract HP points on attack.

## Extra Credit
- Create a button for the user to reset the game
- Allow the user to pick which pokemon they can battle with
- Once the battle is over, a winner should be declared and the game shouldn’t allow for additional attacks
    - Consider what conditions need to be met for the battle to be "over"
